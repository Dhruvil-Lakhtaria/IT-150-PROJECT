#Issues and Bugs

Output/Code formatting issues & suggestions-
1. Instead of asking the user for Enter to be pressed, ask for a character/String like 'N', "go", "next", "continue" etc.
   I faced some issues at times, where the program didn't register pressing Enter as input and I had to spam Enter
   for something to happen or the program skipped asking for input. Also ask for a specific input to continue
   simulating matches after each Match day in a group.

2. Use .nextLine() method of a scanner instead of .next() so that each time input has to be taken,
   the scanner scans only upto the place where the Enter key is pressed.

3. At some places where user input is asked (e.g lines 5, 49, 127) a space is not printed after the colon.

4. Do not show points table, until after some matches have been simulated. (e.g. displaying points table at lines
   (42-47) and (316-321) isn't required).

5. Print "POINTS TABLE:" before the points table is output.

6. Print "SCHEDULE: " before the schedule is output.

7. Add a line space between lines (19,20) , (81, 82) , (135,136) , (152, 153) , (575, 576) , (637, 638) , (674, 675).

8. Instead of printing "SELECT FROM GIVEN OPTIONS" (e.g lines 136, 144, 153 etc.) the menu can be reprinted.

9. (i) For a match, before TeamA vs TeamB is output, "Setting up the next match..." can be printed. Then after a delay
       "Team A vs Team B" can be output.
   (ii) After "TeamA vs TeamB" is output and before the loading delay starts, "Match Begins!" can be printed.

10. To facilitate ease of reading, color can be added to printouts. A color class has been committed to the src
    folder.

11. (int) (Math.random() * 90) + 1;
    The above statement will return a number between 1 and 90 randomly (1 and 90 inclusive). This can be appended to the
    the printouts of the winning and losing team goal scorers, to show the match minute at which the goal was
    scored ( e.g. Line 116 can look like "Ciro Immobile x (3) [10', 50', 90']" ).

Bugs:
1. Extra space between "Press" & "[Enter]" on line 20

2. Doesn't wait for User input and prints "MATCHDAY - #" (e.g. lines 100, 183, 275, 342 etc.)

3. In line 61 option 3, for showing the schedule was entered, but match simulation resumed.

4. Post match day menu for the groups should not be printed (e.g. lines (291-294), (545-548)).

3. After line 554, no message confirming/denying prediction for group2.

4. At line 83, I predicted Denmark will clear Group1. But Denmark failed to do that (lines 297 - 306).
   As a result my score after group1 was 0 (line 310). For Group 2, I predicted Brazil (line 325). Qualified teams
   printout for Group2 doesn't contain Brazil (lines 550-554) yet my points have been updated to 5 (line 559).
   On closer inspection of the quarter final teams, Brazil exists but Spain doesn't (lines 563-571), but
   (lines 550-554) showed that Spain qualified Group2. Hence, the bug here is that Spain is shown to be qualified,
   even though it hasn't qualified and Brazil is not shown in the qualified teams, even though it has qualified.

5. After Finals, lines 689-693 shouldn't be printed.
